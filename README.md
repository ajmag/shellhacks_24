# ShellHacks '24 Project Repository

## Project Overview
Welcome to my repository for the ShellHacks '24 hackathon! This project is a testament to the collaborative efforts and technical challenges tackled during the event. As the lead backend developer, I focused on creating robust APIs and managing the data processing pipeline critical for our application's functionality.

## What This Repository Contains
This repository includes all the backend code developed during ShellHacks '24. Here, you'll find various APIs designed to meet specific needs of our application, ensuring that data flows seamlessly between the frontend and our database systems. The codebase is structured to support multiple use cases, enhancing the user experience by providing efficient data handling and responsiveness.

## Key Features
API Development: Crafted multiple endpoints to handle a wide range of requests, from data retrieval to complex data manipulation tasks.
Database Integration: Implemented advanced database operations using Firestore, which allowed for real-time data syncing and efficient query processing.
Error Handling: Engineered comprehensive error handling mechanisms to ensure the stability and reliability of the backend services.
Scalability: Designed the backend to easily scale and accommodate increasing loads and complex queries as user engagement grows.

## Technical Stack
Backend: Python, Flask

Database: Firestore

Tools: Git for version control, Postman for API testing

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I've significantly enhanced my backend development skills, particularly in creating APIs that are both scalable and efficient. I gained deeper insights into Firestore's capabilities, learning how to optimize data storage and retrieval for high-performance applications. This experience has been invaluable in understanding how to design and implement backend systems that support complex, user-facing applications.

## Conclusion
This hackathon was an incredible opportunity to challenge myself and grow as a developer. I hope this repository serves as a useful resource or inspiration for those interested in backend development, API design, or hackathon project setups.
